<p>The logo can be used to promote this status on AP member web sites, marketing materials (handouts, presentations etc.) and will make it easier for end-users to identify PEPPOL compliant Service Providers.</p>
<p>Similar logos for Certified PEPPOL SMP Providers, PEPPOL Authorities, and APâ€™s who are PEPPOL BIS compliant will also be provided shortly (when these accreditation processes have been fully implemented).</p>
