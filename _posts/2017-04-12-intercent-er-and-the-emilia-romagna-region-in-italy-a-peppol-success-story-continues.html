<p>In Italy, the Emilia-Romagna Region has achieved significant success enabling the <strong>dematerialization of public purchases</strong> for the <strong>whole procurement cycle</strong>, starting from the collection of public requirements and the achievement of digital tenders, to the fully electronic management of orders, dispatch advices and invoices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To reach this goal, assigned to the regional <strong>Agency for the development of electronic markets ‘Intercent-ER’</strong>, Emilia-Romagna focused on a technological solution which could successfully manage a wide range of purchasing procedures and could refer to a unique standard, as widely accepted as possible. Thus, in 2008, Intercent-ER joined the <strong>PEPPOL project</strong> (Pan European Public Procurement On Line) as a founder member; a project involving several contracting authorities from 12 different countries, with the aim of developing <strong>shared technical standards and solutions for interoperability in e-procurement</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Due to the significant experience gained during the project and continued success in the test-phases that followed, Emilia-Romagna became an early adopter of the PEPPOL standards and developed an articulated strategy to fulfill a complete dematerialization of public purchases.  In particular, with the regional law n. 17 of 2013, the Regional Government officially established the <strong>regional system for the dematerialization of the procurement cycle (named SiCiPa-ER)</strong>, with the purpose of simplifying the public purchasing processes, reducing management costs and guaranteeing the transparency and the traceability of public expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the context of SiCiPa-ER, Intercent-ER has developed and implemented the <strong>Regional Telematic Interchange Hub</strong> (named <strong>NoTI-ER</strong>), a technological infrastructure based on European standards and<strong> freely available to all regional public administrations</strong> in order to manage the <strong>dematerialization, e-transmission</strong> and <strong>e-storage</strong> of all documents related to the procurement cycle, such as orders, dispatch advices and invoices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Starting in 2014, widely anticipating the national deadline for the adoption of electronic invoices, the regional Health Trusts in Emilia-Romagna have been able to digitally exchange all of their <strong>invoices</strong>.  Moreover, from June 2016, the same Health Trusts have also been able to send and receive <strong>orders and dispatch advices</strong> electronically, based on PEPPOL standards. To date, NoTI-ER has handled more than <strong>100,000 e-orders, 130,000 e-dispatch advices and 1,8 million e-invoices.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Furthermore, Intercent-ER  developed the first Italian <strong>PEPPOL Access Point</strong>, and has become the registration site (PEPPOL ‘SMP’) for the Emilia-Romagna Region. Intercent-ER has also defined the <strong>technical rules for using PEPPOL</strong> in relation to invoices, orders and dispatch advices, available on the Intercent-ER website at: <strong><a class="broken_link" data-wpel-link="external" href="http://intercenter.regione.emilia-romagna.it/noti-er-fatturazione-elettronica-1" rel="external noopener noreferrer">http://intercenter.regione.emilia-romagna.it/noti-er-fatturazione-elettronica-1</a>.</strong></p>
