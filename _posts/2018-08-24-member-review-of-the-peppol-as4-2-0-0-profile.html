<div class="single-content">
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the member review of the PEPPOL AS4 Profile v.2.0.0 which can be found on </span><a class="broken_link" data-wpel-link="external" href="http://test-docs.peppol.eu/ticc/as4/specification" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://test-docs.peppol.eu/ticc/as4/specification.</span></a></p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for a revision of the PEPPOL AS4 profile came from the realisation that version 1, that was published in the end of 2017, was found to be not fully compliant with the <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eDelivery+AS4+-+1.13" rel="noopener external noreferrer" target="_blank">CEF eDelivery AS4 specification</a>. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This divergence has created problems for Service Providers funded by CEF to implement AS4 but also raised a strategic challenge for OpenPEPPOL as countries are coming onboard requiring compliance with CEF eDelivery as a high-level policy.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Version 2.0.0 is fully compliant with the CEF AS4 profile. That will remain an overarching priority that will guide the change management process. As a consequence, comments during this member review that would potentially create diversions from CEF eDelivery will not be adopted directly but collected by the Transport Infrastructure Coordinating Community Change Management Board (TICC CMB) and submitted to CEF eDelivery as change requests to their profile. With this approach, OpenPEPPOL will safeguard CEF eDelivery compliance but also maintain our autonomy by leveraging our influence to CEF specifications by contributing requirements as a stakeholder to the CEF eDelivery change management process.</span></p>
