<div class="single-content">
<p>The European Commission’s Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) recently published an article about the success of PEPPOL, starting from the initial project phase in 2008, through the establishment of the OpenPEPPOL Association in 2012 and the signing of a Letter of Understanding (LoU) between the Commission and OpenPEPPOL 2016, where the parties agreed a plan for the transition of the PEPPOL network from AS2 to the CEF eDelivery AS4 messaging protocol.</p>
<p>An excerpt from the article on the success of PEPPOL, to date:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“Today more than 110.000 public and private sector entities are part of the PEPPOL eDelivery network through 160 certified Access Points in 19 Member States. More than six million electronic invoices and other eProcurement documents are exchanged every month, using the PEPPOL eDelivery network. OpenPEPPOL has more than 260 members from 27 countries. Several European Member States, including Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, UK and Norway (EEA) have established PEPPOL Authorities to support implementation of PEPPOL based eProcurement and/or e-invoicing at national and Pan-European level.”</em></p></blockquote>
