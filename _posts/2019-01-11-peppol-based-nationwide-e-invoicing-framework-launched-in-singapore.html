<p><strong>The official launch took place at an event in Singapore January 9th and was made by the Minister for Communications and Information, Mr. S Iswaran. 11 Access Point providers are already offering their services in Singapore, and companies in the Republic will now be able to start exchanging e-invoices via the PEPPOL eDelivery Network.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In May 2018, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) became the first National Authority outside of Europe to join OpenPEPPOL as a PEPPOL Authority. Since joining, efforts have been underway to implement the PEPPOL Business Interoperability Specifications (BIS) for e-invoicing and the PEPPOL eDelivery Network. These have been completed and the network is now live.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To support the exchange of invoices within Singapore, IMDA has developed an extension on the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0. The extension takes into consideration Singapore’s GST tax requirements, and helps companies comply with Singapore tax laws through PEPPOL easily. This can be one catalyst to encourage further international trade. The SG PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 specification and its validation artefacts can be found and downloaded through the PEPPOL Post-Award Download page (<a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://peppol.eu/downloads/post-award/">https://peppol.eu/downloads/post-award/</a>).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Singapore’s PEPPOL Authority, IMDA has also appointed its subsidiary Singapore Network Information Centre (SGNIC) to operate the Service Metadata Publisher (SMP). The SMP lists all the companies registered on the Singapore PEPPOL eDelivery Network and allows Access Points (APs) to look up companies before sending them e-invoices. The SMP service will be offered as a free service by SGNIC.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the national PEPPOL Authority, IMDA is also responsible for the certification of local Access Point providers (APs). Companies or e-invoice service providers will need to connect to the PEPPOL network through APs. IMDA has already certified an initial batch of 11 AP providers. These APs include both local and overseas service providers which offer a wide range of services to meet various business requirements. There are an additional 10 APs who have started the certification process, with more expected over time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To encourage early adoption in the private sector, part of a $30 million (€20 million) funding scheme announced January 9th will be used for e-invoice adoption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the government front, IMDA is working with several key government agencies, such as Accountant General’s Department (AGD), to drive the adoption of e-invoicing. AGD is joining the nationwide e-invoicing framework to provide government vendors with greater options when transacting with the government, in addition to the current Vendors@Gov system. AGD will be sourcing for a service provider in the coming months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Singapore Government is committed to coming onboard the nationwide e-invoicing network and more details will be provided later in the year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In response to the progress which Singapore has made since joining OpenPEPPOL, Mr. André Hoddevik, OpenPEPPOL Secretary General noted, “We are happy to see the central role Singapore has given the PEPPOL approach in their national strategy for e-invoicing”. He added, “With IMDA as the first PEPPOL Authority outside of Europe, the official launch of the PEPPOL eDelivery Network in Singapore is a big milestone for OpenPEPPOL. We appreciate that Singapore now serves as an example for other countries outside of Europe that are considering strategies to support domestic and cross-border E-invoicing.”</p>
