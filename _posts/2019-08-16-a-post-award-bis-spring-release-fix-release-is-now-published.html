<p>This release from OpenPEPPOL includes changes to the mandatory validation artefacts for all published PEPPOL BIS 3.0 documents as distributed by email to the OpenPEPPOL Post Award community on July 19th</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The BIS 3.0 specifications in this release are <strong>mandatory from August 16th, 2019 12:00 CEST.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Validation artefacts are the tools that help parties and service providers to comply with the PEPPOL Transport Infrastructure Agreements (TIA) as they help to ensure that the contents of the exchanged document instances in the PEPPOL network are valid both from a syntactical and semantic point of view. These business rules check for the correctness of the coded values, co-occurrence constraints or calculations. It is therefore necessary to use them before submitting documents to the network, in order to ensure the overall quality of exchanged electronic documents, and thus the overall performance of the network.</p>
