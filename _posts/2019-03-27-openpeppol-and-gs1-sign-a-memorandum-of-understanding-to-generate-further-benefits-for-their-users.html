<p> </p>
<p>On 27th March 2019, at the OpenPEPPOL Annual General Assembly, OpenPEPPOL and GS1 formally signed a Memorandum of Understanding to initiate collaborative working.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both OpenPEPPOL and GS1 play an important role in enabling electronic business around the world and are confident about the added value that their collaboration can create for end users of their respective standards. Both organisations are neutral players that enable electronic trading across organisations and borders by providing interoperability between systems, for the benefit of business, the public sector and citizens.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To generate further benefits for their members, the two organisations will establish a deeper working relationship to share technical expertise and undertake joint activities where their respective services and solutions overlap. OpenPEPPOL and GS1 will align their promotional and communications materials to provide clarity for end users of their services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Announcing the agreement, André Hoddevik, Secretary General of OpenPEPPOL, said: “<em>I am pleased that we have reached this important understanding with GS1. There is great potential in ensuring our respective standards are in alignment and ensuring that our service providers and end users understand how to maximise the benefits that can be derived by implementing GS1 and PEPPOL standards and solutions. I look forward to working together with GS1 over the coming year”</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Miguel Lopera, President and CEO of GS1 said: “<em>The recently approved GS1 Electronic Data Interchange (“EDI”) strategy sets the grounds for adopting seamlessly new technologies such as Universal Business Language (“UBL”). The Memorandum of Understanding will enable to explore and discuss in good faith the use of GS1 identification keys and GS1 EDI standards in PEPPOL as well as the use of PEPPOL services by GS1 member companies. We are looking forward to a closer collaboration with OpenPEPPOL for the benefit of the GS1 global user community”</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding has an initial term of two years and will be reviewed annually, with continuation by mutual consent.</p>
