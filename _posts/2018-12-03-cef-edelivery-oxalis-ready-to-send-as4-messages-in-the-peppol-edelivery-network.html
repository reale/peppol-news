<p>Oxalis, a popular open source Access Point implementation in the PEPPOL eDelivery Network, now offers hot pluggable AS4 support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eDelivery" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) eDelivery building block</a> proposes the use of the AS4 messaging protocol to create a secure channel for the transmission of documents and data by electronic means, over the internet or via a private network. AS4 provides both evidence relating to the handling of the transmitted data as well as protecting it against the risk of loss, theft, damage or any unauthorized alterations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PEPPOL is a set of artefacts and specifications enabling cross-border eProcurement. The use of PEPPOL is governed by a multi-lateral agreement structure, which is owned and maintained by OpenPEPPOL.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Norwegian Agency for Public Management and eGovernment (<a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.difi.no/" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Difi</a>), has implemented the latest version of the PEPPOL AS4 profile, in line with the generic eDelivery AS4 profile (deployed in multiple European projects).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Oxalis v4.03 AS4 feature has been passing the CEF eDelivery Connectivity Testing service, where messages were successfully exchanged between Oxalis and Domibus, the sample AS4 access point implementation by the European Commission. Additionally, Oxalis is currently performing the CEF eDelivery Conformance Testing service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Moreover, OpenPEPPOL just launched its <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://peppol.eu/launch-openpeppol-centralized-testbed/">Centralized Testbed</a> through which new Access Point service providers are required to prove compliance to the PEPPOL AS2 and AS4 profiles, before entering the PEPPOL eDelivery Network.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These milestones are great news for the ongoing AS2 to AS4 migration in the PEPPOL eDelivery Network. Existing Oxalis users can effortlessly update their Access Point to provide parallel AS2 and AS4 support by just adding a component to their running Oxalis instance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More instructions on the Oxalis AS4 extension can be obtained <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://github.com/difi/Oxalis-AS4" rel="external noopener noreferrer">here</a><u>.</u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Access Point operators in the PEPPOL eDelivery network that are running another Access Point solution and want to move ahead, can find more information on the AS2 to AS4 migration on the <a data-wpel-link="internal" href="https://peppol.eu/event/peppol-as2-to-as4-migration-info-session-2/">PEPPOL site</a> or by contacting the <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1" rel="external noopener noreferrer">PEPPOL Service Desk</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To stimulate the adoption of AS4 in the Norwegian part of the PEPPOL eDelivery Network, Difi is offering a reward of up to 100.000 NOK (+- 10.000 EUR) among the Access Point providers being the first to report 10.000 AS4 transactions in production. See <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4647203/" rel="external noopener noreferrer">this Difi LinkedIN group</a> for more details.</p>
