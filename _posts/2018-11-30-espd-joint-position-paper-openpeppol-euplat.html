<p>As a first initiative following the cooperation between OpenPEPPOL and EUPLAT, a joint position paper on ESPD has been produced to affirm the value of establishing interoperable solutions for ESPD implementations in Europe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both parties share a common concern for the individual national implementations of the European standards for e-Tendering, hence the position paper, which aims to showcase and emphasize the mature capability of ESPD to represent a best practice for the implementation of standardized procurement messages in the Pre-Award domain.</p>
<p> </p>
