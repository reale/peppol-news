<p> </p>
<p>There is currently ongoing work to revise the PEPPOL Agreement Framework in order to maintain its alignment with developing specifications, policies and domains.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <a data-wpel-link="external" href="https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Public/pages/189563026/PEPPOL+Agreement+Framework" rel="external noopener noreferrer">current Transport Infrastructure Agreement</a> (TIA) was developed in 2012 to provide interoperability in the PEPPOL eDelivery Network. Since then, PEPPOL has expanded with new PEPPOL Authorities, new application domains and new types of service providers with differing Service Level requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To support future operations and continued interoperability in a dynamic and expanding market, OpenPEPPOL have decided to prepare and implement a revised agreement framework.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OpenPEPPOL invites all interested parties to a series of webinars where the overarching plan and strategy for the new PEPPOL Agreement Framework will be presented, and the impact of the revision can be discussed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The webinars will provide ample opportunity to ask questions and make clarifications about the content of the changes and the consequences they may represent for your business.</p>
