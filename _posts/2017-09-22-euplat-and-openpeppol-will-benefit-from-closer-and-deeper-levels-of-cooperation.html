<p><strong>EUPLAT and OpenPEPPOL will benefit from closer and deeper levels of cooperation</strong></p>
<p>The European Association of Public eTendering Platform Providers (EUPLAT) and the Open Pan European Public Procurement Online (OpenPEPPOL) have signed today in Brussels a Memorandum of Understanding for a closer cooperation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With this agreement, both associations aim to achieve a more effective and efficient implementation of the full spectrum of innovative changes required by the Directive 2014/24/EC on public markets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>EUPLAT and OpenPEPOL will work together in areas such as the Governance of the pre-award interoperability infrastructure, increasing the level of participation in each other’s governance forums and creating more opportunities for joint meetings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the key issues in focus in this collaboration is to support the implementation of a true interoperable e-Tendering environment in Europe by joint communication and extended collaboration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As Miguel Sobral, Chairman of EUPLAT, said: “The combination of OpenPEPPOL’s experience in the interoperability’s infrastructure and its Governance, combined with the experience of the EUPLAT members operating Public eProcurement platforms supporting the pre-award in most of the EU, will be a major step forward to implement a sustainable, inclusive and replicable interoperability framework.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Associations aim to create awareness and engagement amongst stakeholders by providing joint position papers on strategic topics and by join forces in showcasing the Business Case of Pan-European interoperability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first step in the collaboration between the Associations is the provision of a Position Paper laying out the value of establishing interoperable solutions for ESPD implementations in Europe.</p>
<p> </p>
