<p>On Friday February 22nd, 2019 the Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers, Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern announced Australia and New Zealand’s intention to adopt the PEPPOL interoperability framework for e-Invoicing to increase opportunities for businesses to integrate with the global trading environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the announcement by the Australian government, it was said that the Australian and New Zealand governments intend to finalise their membership of PEPPOL by mid-2019. This will enable the transition to PEPPOL to take place by the end of the year, with businesses able to access the e-Invoicing framework from that time.</p>

<p>A joint statement by the two Prime Ministers was also released today by the government of New Zealand, announcing the creation of the Australia and New Zealand Electronic Invoicing Board (ANZEIB) “to help drive an estimated A$30 billion in savings in over 10 years in Australia and New Zealand”, stating their intention to jointly adopt the PEPPOL interoperability framework for trans-Tasman eInvoicing.</p>
