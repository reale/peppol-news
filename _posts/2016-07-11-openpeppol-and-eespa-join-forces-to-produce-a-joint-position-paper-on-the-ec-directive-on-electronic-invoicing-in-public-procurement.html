<p><strong>As a first initiative following the recently announced cooperation between OpenPEPPOL and EESPA, a joint position paper has been produced to provide feedback to the European Commission regarding Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement.</strong></p>
<p>Both parties have significant concerns with a provision in the Directive requiring all public sector contracting authorities to be capable of receiving electronic invoices in up to four syntaxes (technical languages).</p>
<p>The main concern is the complexity of supporting too many e-Invoicing standards which could inadvertently have a detrimental impact on the success of the initiative. In that light, OpenPEPPOL and EESPA have recommended two alternative options that they hope will be taken into consideration. The first being a recommendation to restrict the total number of syntaxes and the second being a recommendation to allow for some of the syntaxes to be optional.</p>
