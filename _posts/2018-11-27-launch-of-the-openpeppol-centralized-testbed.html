<p><strong>Introduction: </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>OpenPEPPOL is now launching the centralized Testbed for AS2 and AS4 onboarding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The latest approved PEPPOL AS4 profile can be located here:</p>
<p><a data-wpel-link="external" href="http://docs.peppol.eu/edelivery/as4/specification/" rel="external noopener noreferrer">http://docs.peppol.eu/edelivery/as4/specification/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This test facility will replace the Difi operated Acceptance Test and all new Access Point service providers are required to use this centralized service for proving compliance to the PEPPOL AS2 and AS4 profiles, going forward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first version of the Testbed is designed to be a self-driven process with four test cases that must all be completed, sequentially. Going forward, the goal is to expand the Testbed with additional test cases and other key verifications, to ensure that all new service providers operate with the same high quality of service that characterizes Access Points already operating in the PEPPOL eDelivery Network.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Testbed will be operational from <strong>28-11-2018</strong></p>
<p> </p>
