# What is PEPPOL

PEPPOL stands for Pan-European Public Procurement OnLine. The network was
established as a test project by the European Commission in 2008.

Organizations that are now connected to PEPPOL can exchange business documents,
such as various electronic formats, through the highly secured and safe
international network.
